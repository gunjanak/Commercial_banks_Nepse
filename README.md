Design of Stock Trading Agent Using Recurrent Neural Network
Stock market prediction is a difficult task as it is extremely complex and volatile. Re-searchers are exploring methods to obtain good performance in stock market predic-tion. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a special type of an artificial neural networkadapted to work for time series data or data that involves sequences. Ordinary feedforward neural networks are only meant for data points, which are independent of eachother. However, if we have data in a sequence such that one data point depends uponthe previous data point, we need to modify the neural network to incorporate the de-pendencies between these data points. RNNs have the concept of ‘memory’ that helpsthem store the states or information of previous inputs to generate the next output ofthe sequence. In this project, we compare different variations of unidirectional RNNmodels such as LSTM and GRU and bidirectional RNN models such as BLSTM andBGRU to forecast stock prices of all 27 commercial banks listed in NEPSE.This project compares LSTM, GRU, BLSTM and BGRU in terms of training timeand MAPE.
